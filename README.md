# Multi-Class Texture Analysis in Colorectal Cancer Image Classification

A Computer Vision (CV) project inspired by Kaggle.

## Requirement
R

## How to Use
Copy all the source code in `src` directory to the same hierachical level as `data` directory.

## Summary

- Preprocessed 5000 images using feature engineering (dimensionality reduction) including PCA and texture analysis (R and MATLAB); Performed model selection via cross-validation to ensemble MLR, SVM, RF, XGBoost

- Developed interpretable and parsimonious model to increase accuracy (90.8%) by 6.4% compared to DL models
